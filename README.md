## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There is a large homeless population in the San Francisco, California area, specifially in the Tenderloin neighborhood of SF. It is no secret that hunger is a dominating issue among the homeless, however, hunger is not unique to homeless. Hunger has no face and has varying degrees. Considering the high standard of living in San Francisco, the issue of hunger may actually be more prevalent than expected. For many people, every dollar makes a difference.For some going out to eat or for a cup of coffee with coworkers or peers may require a quick calculation of their funds. Some may even have to skip meals because they cannot afford to eat. And while some people would enjoy a free meal, others require it. BrokeAsF is for these people. 

BrokeAsF is a simple web application aimed to provide users with locations offering free meals near them in real time in t\
he San Francisco area.
