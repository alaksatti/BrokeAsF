kasean herrera im sorry u must hate me but thats ok
youre dead
and i will think whatever i want
no one can tell me the truth
you might hate me
you might love me
or worse
you might not even care about me
do you remember me
do you think of me
do you care
who am i to you
do you hate it that i think about you all the time
do you find it weird
do you find it creepy
do you wish i would just move on
do you want me to move on
do you insist i move on
do you find me annoying
do you find me pathetic
how could you not
my life is in shambles
not becuase i lack opportunity
but because of me
im not allowing myself to take opportunities
and sieze my time
or reach my full potential
im so sad
im so depressed
im so broken
my heart is broken
my will is broken
i dont care about any of this anymore
i still feel shy to be around successfull people
because im not
not even a little
and i know that would disappoint you
and more than that
if you were to care about me at all right now
you wouldnt after meeting me today
im a shell of a person
i dont take care of myself
and im bumming it
at 26 yrs old now
ive never had a job
or made my own money
still sucking my parents dry
even tho i graduated 4 yrs ago
what have i been doing this whole time?
you died 3 years ago
i wonder where i would be if you didnt die
where we would be
although realistically i know we wouldnt be
except if we were forced to come into each others paths
and i like to think that back then maybe things wouldve been different
but i think they wouldve been the same
broken hearted
full of regret
and pain
there was no winning
we werent supposed to be forever
and thats why we werent
your death wasnt gunna change that
but then what about me
idk if i can pull myself from this
ive wasted 3 years!
just grieving someone who doesnt remember me
who might not exist
kasean do you care
im so hurt over you
im obsessing over you
and you may have never felt the same way
or maybe you did
but its a past tense
am i really this pathetic
you died
and i also died
i just dont know if i have the merit to be this depressed
what are you thinking
im sure you think this is pathetic
and that im crazy
maybe you were in love with me
thats whta i want to believe
so then when did you fall out of love with me
because maybe if you did really love me
then i would be with you
and not here
im confident in how i feel about you
but insecure in how you feel about me
i know if i died an anyone else besides you and my close friends
were this broken adn this obsessed
i would think they were weird
i wouldnt appreciate them thinking of me this much
in fact it would be unwanted
if i had any pull from the other side
i would use all of it to make them understand its
totally one sided
and to be clear that side is theirs
so im wondering do you feel that way about me
am i being too much
i feel like if i have to ask that
then i probably most definitley am
i need to get help
see someone
and move on
becuase surely and most def
you have
alone
without me
